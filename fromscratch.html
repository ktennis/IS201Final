        <p>On Tuesday, District 8 was bombed for the second time. This time, the capitol targeted a hospital full of wounded men, women, and children. There were no survivors. Katniss Everdeen (The Mockingjay) and her crew had been visiting the hospital right before the bombing. They were planning on shooting a propo in another area of 8 when the bombing started. They were able to shoot down some of the Capitol's bombers. The Mockingjay is alive and well and has a message for everyone. "I want to tell the rebels that I am alive. That I'm right here in District 8, where the Capitol has just bombed a hospital full of unarmed men, women, and children. There will be no survivors. I want to tell people that if you think for second that the Capitol will treat us fairly if there's a cease-fire, you're deluding yourself. Because you know who they are and what they do. This is what they do! And we must fight back! President Snow says he's sending us a message? Well, I have one for him. You can torture us and bomb us and burn our districts to the ground, but do you see that? Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!" </p>
